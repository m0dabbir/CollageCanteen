## Alzheimer’s Early Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease based on demographic and lifestyle features. The goal is to support early diagnosis and intervention using a cost-effective, data-driven approach.

### Features:

* Preprocessed real-world data for consistency and accuracy
* Implemented multiple ML models:

  * Decision Tree
  * Random Forest
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * CatBoost
  * XGBoost
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
* Visualized data patterns and model performance using Matplotlib

### Tech Stack:

* **Languages & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Problem Type**: Binary classification
* **Outcome**: Reliable prediction framework to assist in early risk detection and healthcare decision-making
